Analysis-Report-on-AI-Ethics-and-Legal-Loopholes-A-Case-Study-of-Steven-Anderegg

Report Introduction: This report provides an in-depth analysis of the landmark case of software engineer Steven Anderegg, who used the open-source AI model Stable Diffusion to generate illicit images. It systematically explores the threefold challenges of generative AI in technical, ethical, and legal dimensions.

Research Contributions:

In-depth Case Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the case, revealing technical misuse , ethical dilemmas (such as developer responsibility and the societal harm of synthetic content) , and the lag in legal frameworks.

Technical Vulnerability Research: Researched the working principles of diffusion models represented by Stable Diffusion and their security risks within an open-source architecture.

Solution Recommendations: Proposed a systematic solution encompassing legislative updates , technological reinforcement (e.g., built-in content filters, forensic watermarking) , and cross-domain collaboration.
